*Part 3: Exploring JS -- Objects, Tools and Testing*

# P4: Classic Arcade Game Clone

This project was mainly an exercise in object-oriented Javascript. I had to make use of class functions or class prototype functions. Also the keyword `this` were to be used appropriately in that it refered to the object the function was called upon.

## How to run the game

To run the game, download this repo onto your local machine. Unzip it and start `index.html` in your favorite browser. Its just tested for the latest version of chrome though (<= v. 67 at the time of writing this).

## Instructions

- Use your arrow keys to move the player: up, down, left, right
- Ensure your player doesn't collide with the bugs
- Reach the water to "win" the game
